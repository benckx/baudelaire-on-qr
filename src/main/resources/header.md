# About

Encode a well-known book as a series of QR codes. Just a silly demo project.

The QR is not a link, but actually _contains_ the text.

Depending on the size of QR (i.e. the version; in this case 22) and Error Correction level (this in case L), we are able
to store texts up to 1003 characters on each QR.
